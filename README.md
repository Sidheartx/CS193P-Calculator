## Contact

I'm sharing my code so that I can discuss the solutions with other iTunesU watchers. If you're also
working on the same problems, have an idea you want to ask me about, or have an improvement in mind,
feel free to reach out to me by starting an Issue.

## Disclaimer

I'm not promising that my code is correct, works, or will get you full credit for any
submissions. I'm learning and following along just like everyone else. I encourage you to do all
of the assignments on your own to get the most out of the experience.
